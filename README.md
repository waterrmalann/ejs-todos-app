A full-stack todo application built using Express, with EJS as the view engine and MongoDB as the database.

**This application is designed to incorporate the following basic features:**
- Basic user registration and subsequent login.
- Ability to create, read, update, and delete todos.
- Persist the data to an external database (MongoDB).

**Several other coding practices have been implemented as well:**
- Follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and well documented code.
- Robust session handling, with no loose errors or bugs.
- Form validation and server side validation.
